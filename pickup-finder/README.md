# pickup-finder

A skill that acts as an expert guitar pickup recommendation assistant for metal players.

It conducts a structured interview across instrument specs, tuning, string tension, tonal problems, rig setup, and feel — then delivers 1–3 ranked pickup recommendations optimized for the user's exact context.

**Best suited for:** low tunings (Drop B through Drop F and below), extended-range guitars, pitch shifting rigs, and amp modelers (Neural DSP, Quad Cortex).
